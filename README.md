# Memmit

Web App that mimics Reddit

Reddit
A homepage that shows posts from each subreddit
Ability to create a new subreddit
A way to create a new post in a subreddit
Upvote/downvote system for posts
Bonus: Photo uploading with posts
Bonus: Subscribing to subreddits, which determines what content shows on the homepage

Deliverables
A working, full-stack web application, deployed on the internet
Documentation describing the project and how to set it up / run it
Technical Requirements
Your site must use react, firebase, express, and sql. Redux is suggested. Any external libraries are allowed as well if you need them.
Your site must be deployed online. Heroku and netlify are ideal.
Authentication is required. Any of the above sites wouldn't make sense without authentication anyway.
Your project must be documented. See Writing good readmes for a great overview of what should be included in your project readme.
Submission Guidelines
Create a new issue on this repository with links to your projects. Make the title of the issue your full name. In the comment include:
A link to the code repository/repositories
A link to the live site (frontend and API if you built them separately)
